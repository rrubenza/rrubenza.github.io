								<p>
									Below is a list of questions I have compiled that are good to be considering 
									when choosing a graduate school.  Many of these questions are draw from 
									<a href="http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/rebull/goodquestions.html#ToC5">Luisa Rebull's website</a>.  
									She also has <a href="http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/rebull/womensci.html">many great links</a> for women 
									(and everyone) in science.
